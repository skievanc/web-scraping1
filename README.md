# Web-scraping a Wikipedia article
Author: Evan Collins


The code scrapes the body text of the Spruce Hole Bog entry on wikipedia.
It takes the URL of the page parses it, then pulls just 'p' tagged items.
The 'p' tags denote paragraphs. 
A loop then prints the text of the paragraphs. 
The output is the pragraph text of the Wikipedia page.

I was trying to figure out a way to grab a specific paragraph of text without having to count which number paragraph it was.
Couldn't quite figure it out so I just did all the paragraphs.
